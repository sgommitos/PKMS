## Introduction

`PKMS`, which stands for *Personal Knowledge Management System*, is a SW which consists in a REPL, used to handle user's PKM.

The goal is to create a SW that has the following requirements:
- Simple 
    - In terms of development : it should follow the *suckless* SW development philosophy
    - In terms of usability   : it should be as simple as possible for everybody, even if it's not used to use terminal
- Cross-Platform
    - It should run on the major OS (i.e: Linux, MacOS, Windows)
- User-Edit-Ready:
    - Everybody should be able to edit the code themselves. 

Due to these requirements, i've decided to develop `PKMS` using Python.
